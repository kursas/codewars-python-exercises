## Keep up the hoop

Alex just got a new hula hoop, he loves it but feels discouraged because his little brother is better than him

Write a program where Alex can input (`n`) how many times the hoop goes round and it will return him an encouraging message :)

- If Alex gets 10 or more hoops, return the string `"Great, now move on to tricks"`.
- If he doesn't get 10 hoops, return the string `"Keep at it until you get it"`.

### Given Code


```python
def hoop_count(n):
    pass
```

---

### Solution


```python
def hoop_count(n):
    return "Great, now move on to tricks" if n >= 10 else "Keep at it until you get it"
```
