## Convert a String to a Number!


We need a function that can transform a string into a number. What ways of achieving this do you know?

Note: Don't worry, all inputs will be strings, and every string is a perfectly valid representation of an integral number.


**Examples**

```python
stringToNumber("1234") == 1234
stringToNumber("605" ) == 605
stringToNumber("1405") == 1405
stringToNumber("-7"  ) == -7
```

### Given Code


```python
def string_to_number(s):
    pass
```

---

### Solution


```python
def string_to_number(s):
    return int(s)
```
