## Find the unique number


There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!


```python
find_uniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) == 2
find_uniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) == 0.55
```

Itâ€™s guaranteed that array contains at least 3 numbers.

The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.

```python
def find_uniq(arr):
    # your code here
